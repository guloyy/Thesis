# Thesis
collection of codes used for our thesis
- The file plots_compact contains the two functions that we have used throughout the project in order to plot the time series as well as the scatter plots in the beginning. Then it portrays the plots. These codes have been updated several times depending on the various needs of the measurements.
- RF_sulfate and RF_nitrate contain the code for random forest algorithms that we ran for the both species seperately.
